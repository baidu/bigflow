 * Utility trait for classes that want to log data. Creates a SLF4J logger for the class and allows
 * logging messages at different levels using methods that only evaluate parameters lazily if the
 * log level is enabled.

 * NOTE: DO NOT USE this class outside of Spark. It is intended as an internal utility.
 * This will likely be changed or removed in future releases.
